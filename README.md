## Contributions:

The contributions I need involve primarily finding reputable quotes and articles that corroborates the bullet points listed in the index.php file.

Additional contributions could be equally as helpful, but less visible. I would like people who are more knowledgeable than myself to make sure that each point in the project 2025 manual is properly referenced, and not overstated or otherwise incorrect. My goal for this is to be fact based, not create an opinionated or overly interpreted page.

I've had success so far by just scanning through the first 20 or so executive orders signed by our new president.
