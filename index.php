                <p>
                    In the run-up to the 2024 election, <span class="highlight">Donald Trump</span> tried to <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/08/22/g-s1-19202/trump-project-2025-border-immigration" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">distance himself</a> from <em>Project 2025</em>, claiming he had nothing to do with it.
                    But now, as his administration lays the groundwork for 2025, it has become clear: <span class="highlight">this blueprint is his playbook</span>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Crafted by <span class="highlight">The Heritage Foundation and over 50 far-right organizations</span>,
                    <em>Project 2025: Mandate for Leadership</em> outlines an extreme plan to reshape America‚Äîgutting civil rights protections, slashing social programs,
                    weaponizing the government against political opponents, and expanding presidential power to <strong>unprecedented</strong> levels.
                </p>

                <p>This website exists to <strong>track and expose</strong> the implementation of <em>Project 2025</em>‚Äîpolicy by policy, department by department. Below, you'll find:</p>

                    Dismantle regulatory agencies to remove oversight on industries, weakening environmental protections, labor rights, and consumer protections (p. 582).

                <li>
                    Increase presidential control over federal agencies by reducing their autonomy, ensuring they align closely with the president's policy objectives (p. 75).
                </li>
                <li>Limit the influence of career civil servants by restructuring the Executive Office of the President to have more direct oversight over agency decisions (p. 76).</li>
                <li>

But the Biden Administration egregiously rejected merit-based hiring, requiring all executive departments and agencies to implement dangerous ‚Äúdiversity equity and inclusion‚Äù tactics, and specifically recruiting individuals with ‚Äúsevere intellectual‚Äù disabilities in the FAA."

                We're only a few days into his presidency, and it's pretty clear that <span class="highlight">Donald Trump</span> is wasting no time in implementing the <em>Project 2025</em> agenda.
            </p>
            <p>
                The only reason he tried to distance himself from the project is because he knew it was too extreme for most Americans. But now that he's in power, he's doing everything he can to make it a reality.
